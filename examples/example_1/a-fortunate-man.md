First Chapter.

In one of the small market towns in East Jutland, tucked away among green hills at the bottom of an overgrown fjord, lived a priest by the name of Johannes Sidenius during the years before and after our last war. He was a pious and strict man. In his outward appearance as well as his overall lifestyle, he set himself sharply apart from the town's other inhabitants and was therefore regarded for many years as an inconvenient stranger, whose peculiarities people alternately shrugged off and were scandalized by. When he — tall and serious — walked through the town's winding streets, dressed in his long grey homespun coat, with large dark blue glasses over his eyes and his hand clenched around the handle of a large cotton umbrella, which he drove forcefully into the cobblestones with every step, people involuntarily turned to look at him; and those who were sitting inside behind windows and keeping watch in the street mirror smiled at the sight or made faces. The town's big guns, the old farmer-merchants and cattle breeders, never greeted him, not even when he was wearing vestments. Although they themselves appeared on the street in clogs and dirty linen jackets and puffing on a pipe, they considered it a shame and disgrace for their town that it had been saddled with such a ragtag priest, who dressed like a village clerk and admittedly struggled to provide food for himself and his litter of offspring. People had been used to quite a different kind of clergy here - men in fine, black clothes and white cambric neckbands, men who also by their name brought prestige to the town and its church and later became deans and bishops, but who nevertheless hadn't pride themselves with their piety, nor felt too superior to take an interest in the town's secular affairs and participate in the citizens' social pursuits.

Back then, the large, red vicarage had been a home of hospitality, where one, once having settled their matters with the priest, was invited into the living room to join the lady of the house and the young mistresses for a cup of coffee or (for the upper class) a small glass of wine and a homemade cake to chat about the day's and town's news. Now people did not set foot in the vicarage without pressing reasons, and they never went beyond Pastor Sidenius' tomb-like study room, where the curtains were often half-down because the priest's eyes could not bear the reflection from the walls across the narrow street.

Here, he would often receive people standing, not inviting them to sit, dismissing them quickly and seemingly unaffected, particularly least accommodating towards those who believed themselves entitled to special consideration. Even the city's official families had stopped visiting the parsonage, after having been subjected by Pastor Sidenius - instead of offering refreshments - to inquiries about their faith, addressing them in such a manner as if they were confirmands standing on the church floor.

He provoked a very special resentment at the large citizen funerals, where the population arrived in festive procession, with brass band music and lavishly adorned guild banners, officials in gold-braided uniforms and with cock feathers in their hats - all according to their own belief especially well tuned for devotion and edification after the light port wine lunch at the mourning home. Instead of a big speech with the usual praise of the deceased, Pastor Sidenius invariably limited himself to uttering a prayer, as was otherwise only used for unbaptized children and the needy poor. Not a word about the honorable character or industrious conduct of the departed, not a hint at his merits towards the growth of the town or his self-sacrificing interest in the cobblestone department or the municipal water works. It was hardly enough that the deceased was mentioned at all by the grave, and then always only with additions like "this wretched pile of dust" or "this feed for worms” — and the larger and more respectable the assembly he spoke to, the more banners and banners fluttered in the wind around the grave, the shorter the prayer became, and the more pitiful the remains were, under which people gathered, so that the crowd dispersed under an excitement that more than once had audibly vented itself right there in the cemetery.
