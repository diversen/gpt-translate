This is minimal howto about translating a long text using GPT using php.

It translates markdown texts, e.g. a novel, from one language to another. 

It does the job quite well, but in many cases you will need to edit

the translation, but it may serve as a good starting point. 

It is only tested using markdown text. 

An [examples](examples/index.php) contains the translation 

of "Kongens Fald" into "The fall of the king".
