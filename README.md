# README

This is minimal howto about translating a long text using GPT using php.

It translates markdown texts, e.g. a novel, from one language to another. 

It does the job quite well, but in any case you will need to edit

the translated document if you want a translation of high quality.

The auto-translation may serve as a good starting point. 

It is only tested using markdown text. It will split a document into small
parts based on double lines. And then translate one section at a time. 

## Usage

This example will make an effort to translate the first the part of the danish novel 
'Lykke Per' to english. 

You will need to change the api key in [example/index.php](example/index.php) 

    git clone git@github.com:diversen/gpt-translation.git
    cd gpt-translation

You will need to change the api key in [example/index.php](example/index.php) 
Then run:

    php example/index.php
